### Introduction

This repository is a workshop focused on learning FastAPI and building robust, high-performance, and fully documented web APIs.

You'll learn how to integrate a multimodal model (vision-to-text) for seamless integration with other applications through the API while diving into the full development lifecycle. This includes working with databases, writing unit tests, highlighting the best practices, and creating thorough documentation to ensure well-structured and scalable APIs.
